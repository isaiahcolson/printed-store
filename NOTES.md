# Printed

## Initial Thoughts March 6, 2021
- Have a site for *Printed [blank]* that is a collection of sites that have a store where someone can buy printed planters or printed coasters. Something along those lines.
- Start off with the *Printed Planters* site that will showcase some planters of my creation. This can include a way for a user to buy a planter that I will print and handover to them, or they can purchase an .STL file that they can download and print their own planter.
- The main idea is to have printed ideas that someone can purchase. This could then break off into separate sections that are more specific. There won't be a separate section of the site dedicated to an idea unless it passes a predetermined list of phases.



## Phase Ideas of a Product
1. Ideation
    - A product is conceptualized, sketched and modeled.
    - The product goes through a few design changes based on initial thoughts or feedback.
2. Validation
    - When a product is printed and gets some basic product shots, it can then be posted to the site.
    - If the product does not sell well, then it could remain on the site but not go through any type of reiteration process.
3. Reiteration
    - Based on feedback or thoughts, a product can go through some design changes.
    - If there are a lot of changes, then there could be a version 2. It may even be simpler to make smaller changes and post that back online. This would fit into more of a Kanban approach to creating and selling printed products.
